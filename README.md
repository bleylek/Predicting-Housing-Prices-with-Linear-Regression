Overview:
This project leverages a linear regression model to predict housing prices based on a dataset of house features in the USA. It demonstrates the application of data science techniques to understand and predict real estate valuations.

Objective:
The goal is to apply linear regression to predict housing prices, showcasing the relationship between house features and their market values.

Data Description:
The dataset, USA_Housing.csv, contains multiple features related to housing properties, such as area, number of bedrooms, and age, aimed at predicting the price of a house. Further details about the dataset's structure and source were not specified in the provided notebook.

Technologies Used:
- Python for scripting and model development.
- Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
  Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
- Scikit-learn for implementing the Linear Regression model and model evaluation.
